        	<p> When I was little, just like any other kid, I had huge fascination to animations, cartoons and special effects. As I grew, this 			                fascination never faded, on the contrary, I started liking them so much that I wanted to make them myself. I think this is where                 the seed to my web-developer career started taking roots. I learned Flash, and started making 2D animations. Later on I taught                 myself JavaScript and other scripting languages. Gradually my interest to web-development increased and at this moment,                 developing web-sites has become a 'habit'. It has become a part of my everyday chores. That is what keeps me going. And the best                 part is it makes me happy.</p>
            <p>Apart from web-developing there are other things which I am very interested in. I love food. Loving making them and tasting them.                I make sure I try different cuisines every once in a while. Cars are also something I am very interested in. The BMW Z4 is a car                I'd love to own and that is what I'm pursuing right now. I want to earn enough money to buy a BMW Z4 as soon as possible. Besides                these, I like shopping, partying and reading books. </p>
        
        	<p>For a web-developer following blogs is very important to keep updated with the changing trends and also to learn new tricks. I am                an active follower of a few blogs. Here's the list:</p>
